- 👋 Hi, I’m @LeDon-James, I am new to coding and still trying to wrap my head around the big picture concepts of coding and make sense of it all...
- 👀 I’m interested in coding design specifically creative aspects(aesthetics and function), as of now more interested in front-end design and building projects
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript on Codecademy
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun projects as I learn
- 📫 How to reach me: feel free to contact me on here!
